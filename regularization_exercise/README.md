Part 1 files are contained within the part1 folder, Part 2 files are contained within the part2 folder. Running either script will output their respective linear, lasso, and ridge regression RMSE's into a text file "rmse_results.txt" saved within their respective folder.

Both scripts are running with no code errors at the time of submission.

The RMSE results for submission are in RMSE_Results.txt.
